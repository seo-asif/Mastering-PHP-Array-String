##Task 4: Multidimensional Array
Create a multidimensional array called $studentGrades to store the grades of three students. Each student has grades for three subjects: Math, English, and Science. Write a PHP function which takes "$studentGrades" as an argument to calculate and print the average grade for each student.

##Task 5: Password Generator
Create a PHP function called generatePassword($length) that generates a random password of the specified length. The password should include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+).
